prepFireCanada(
  year,
  type = c("NBAC", "Polygon", "Point"),
  urlBase = "http://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/downloads/nbac/",

}
\arguments{
\item{year}{Numeric, length 1. Which year, from 1986 to 2018 (currently)

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} plus several downloaded files, including
the \file{.zip} archive and the extracted files.
Because it is running \code{prepInputs}, checksumming is occurring too.
}
\description{
Downloads data from CWFIS Datamart at \url{http://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart}.
This runs \code{prepInputs} internally, so use can pass \code{studyArea} etc.
