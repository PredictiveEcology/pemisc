\usage{
getLocalArgsFor(fn, localFormalArgs, envir, dots)
}
\arguments{
\item{fn}{Function name(?)}

\item{localFormalArgs}{A (named) character vector or arguments to}

\item{envir}{The environment in which to (???)}

\item{dots}{TODO: need description}
}
\value{
List of named objects. The names are the formals in \code{fn}, and
the objects are the values for those formals.
This can easily be passed to \code{do.call(fn, args1)}
}
\description{
Search among local objects (which will often be arguments passed into a function) as well as
dot objects to match the formals needed by \code{fn}.
If \code{localFormalArgs} is named, then it will match the formal
(name of \code{localFormalArgs}) with the local object,
e.g., \code{localFormalArgs = c(x = "obj")} will find the object in the local environment called
\code{"obj"}, and this will be found because it matches the \code{x} argument in \code{fn}.
